## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS/Sass (7-1 pattern) for styling
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Media queries for responsiveness
- JSON for data handling
- JavaScript (OLOO - Object Linking to Other Objects) for object-oriented approach
- Gulp for project automation (Sass compilation, vendor prefixes, and deploying to GitHub Pages)

### What I learned

This project allowed me to practice working with:

- **JavaScript object-oriented programming (OLOO pattern)** for handling product cards and cart functionality.
- **SCSS 7-1 pattern** for better organizing stylesheets, ensuring maintainability and scalability.
- **Gulp** for setting up workflows that automated development tasks like compiling SCSS to CSS, live reloading, and deploying to GitHub Pages.
- **Working with JSON** files to dynamically populate product information on the UI.
  
This was my first project on Frontend Mentor using JavaScript, and it helped me learn how to integrate front-end tools effectively.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Great resource for learning more about JavaScript and web development in general.
